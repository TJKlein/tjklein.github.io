### Bio  

Currently, I am Director of AI Research at SAP SE in [Berlin, Germany](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/52.5467648,13.4660096/SAP+MÃ¼nzstr+15/@52.5365216,13.4064717,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m9!4m8!1m1!4e1!1m5!1m1!1s0x47a851e1dab74057:0xae8d4cd859f4c58a!2m2!1d13.406999!2d52.5242668).
Prior to joining SAP, I was a postdoctoral research fellow at Harvard Medical School, Brigham & Women's Hospital, Boston, in the group of [Sandy Wells](https://lmi.med.harvard.edu/people/william-wells). At the same time, I was a postdoctoral research associate in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) at MIT, working with the group of [Polina Goland](https://people.csail.mit.edu/polina/index.html). During that time I was conducting research on large-scale machine learning and optimization technologies for discriminative pattern discovery of genetically driven imaging biomarkers.
I obtained my Ph.D. from Technical University of Munich (TUM) at the intersection of medical imaging and machine learning (raw ultraound data processing for applications such as early detection of Parkinson's disease), advised by [Nassir Navab](http://campar.in.tum.de/Main/NassirNavab).

### Research

My research interests lie in natural language processing (NLP), and at the intersection of NLP computer vision. Although not my current main focus, I am very much interested in machine learning in the medical domain.

*Internship Position:* Our research team is continuously hiring students and interns. If you're a Ph.D. student interested in a research internship working in Berlin, please send an email with your CV and research interests. Right now, we are particularly looking for interns for self-supervised and continual learnin in NLP, as well as privacy ML. Check out our research team's [blog](https://medium.com/sap-machine-learning-research) to learn more about current research activity there.
