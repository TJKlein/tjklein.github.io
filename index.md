## üßë‚Äçüíª About Me

I am a Principal Research Scientist and Research Manager in the **SAP AI CTO Office**, working on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **large language models (LLMs)**, and **machine learning for enterprise structured data**.  
My work spans from advancing foundational AI techniques to delivering enterprise-ready systems ‚Äî including **knowledge-augmented LLMs**, **privacy-preserving AI**, and **intelligent agents** for complex workflows.

Previously, I was a **postdoctoral research fellow** at **Harvard Medical School** and **Brigham & Women‚Äôs Hospital** in Boston, and a **postdoctoral research associate** at the **Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)** at **MIT**.  
I earned my **Ph.D.** from the **Technical University of Munich (TUM)** at the intersection of **medical imaging** and **machine learning**.

Member of the **European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems (ELLIS)**.
