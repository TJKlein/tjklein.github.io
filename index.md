Currently, I am research scientist at [SAP AI Research](https://www.sap.com/germany/products/artificial-intelligence/research.html) as well as an advisor of [MESASIGHT](https://www.mesasight.com/).
Prior to joining SAP, I was a postdoctoral research fellow at Harvard Medical School, Brigham & Women's Hospital, Boston, in the group of [Sandy Wells](https://lmi.med.harvard.edu/people/william-wells). At the same time, I was a postdoctoral research associate in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) at MIT, working with the group of [Polina Goland](https://people.csail.mit.edu/polina/index.html). During that time I was conducting research on large-scale machine learning and optimization technologies for discriminative pattern discovery of genetically driven imaging biomarkers.
I obtained my Ph.D. from Technical University of Munich (TUM) at the intersection of medical imaging and machine learning (raw ultraound data processing for applications such as early detection of Parkinson's disease), advised by [Nassir Navab](http://campar.in.tum.de/Main/NassirNavab).

### Research


My research interests lie in natural language processing (NLP), learning with minimal supervision, natural-language generation, knowledge-graph integration into language models, and the intersection of NLP computer vision. Although not my current main focus, I am very much interested in machine learning in the medical domain.
