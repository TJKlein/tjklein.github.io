## üß† About Me

I am a **Director of Machine Learning Research & Principal Scientist** in the **SAP AI CTO Office**, where I lead research on **large language models (LLMs)**, **foundation models**, and **structured data AI**.  
My mission is to advance how enterprises leverage AI ‚Äî by designing systems that can reason over complex structured data, adapt to limited supervision, and integrate domain-specific knowledge with the general capabilities of LLMs.

I oversee strategic research programs that bridge **fundamental machine learning** and **enterprise-scale deployment**, turning scientific innovation into robust, trustworthy AI platforms.  
This includes developing **foundation models for structured and relational data**, **knowledge-augmented LLMs**, and **agentic AI systems** that coordinate decision-making and automation across business processes.

Over the past decade, I‚Äôve built and led multidisciplinary research teams translating state-of-the-art methods into product-ready technologies ‚Äî shaping how **AI is applied in large-scale enterprise systems**.  
Before joining SAP, I conducted postdoctoral research at **MIT CSAIL** and **Harvard Medical School**, focusing on **representation learning** and **multimodal modeling** for medical imaging.  
I hold a **Ph.D. in Computer Science (summa cum laude)** from the **Technical University of Munich (TUM)** and am a member of the **European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems (ELLIS)**.
