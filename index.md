## Tassilo J. Klein, Ph.D. — AI Research Scientist

I am a Principal Research Scientist and research manager in the SAP AI CTO Office, working on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning for enterprise structured data.

Before joining SAP, I was a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard Medical School and MIT CSAIL, where I studied large‑scale optimisation for genetically driven imaging biomarkers. I completed my Ph.D. at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) on raw‑ultrasound signal processing for early disease detection.

Member, European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems (ELLIS).
